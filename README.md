## FAQ

**Q: Do I really need to learn Excel?**
A: Yes. Unless you want to manually add 500 numbers. Your choice.

**Q: Why are there so many errors?**
A: Excel is judging you. Check your spelling.

**Q: I got #N/A, what does that mean?**
A: Excel couldn't find what you're looking for. Join the club.

**Q: Why is VLOOKUP so hard?**
A: It's not hard, it's just... dramatic. Try XLOOKUP if you have Excel 365.

**Q: Can I use Google Sheets instead?**
A: Sure, but some things will be different. Like my disappointment.

**Q: How much çay should I drink while learning?**
A: Yes.
