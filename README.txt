    ARYAN'S EXCEL MASTERCLASS
    Your Journey from Spreadsheet Newbie to Excel Wizard
============================================================

Hey Aryan! Welcome to your personal Excel bootcamp!

Your bestie put this together for you, so no excuses okay?
Grab some chai, open Excel, and let's make you a spreadsheet pro!

============================================================
REQUIREMENTS
============================================================

To get the most out of this course, you'll need:

- Microsoft Excel 2016 or later (Windows or Mac)
- Excel 365 is RECOMMENDED for the modern formulas (XLOOKUP,
  UNIQUE, FILTER, SORT) - these won't work in older versions!
- If you don't have Excel 365, don't worry - you can still
  learn 95% of the course content with Excel 2016/2019

Note: Google Sheets works for basic practice, but some
features and shortcuts will be different!
