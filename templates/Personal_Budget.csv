TIPS FOR ARYAN:
==========================================================
1. Track expenses DAILY (yes every chai counts)
2. Review weekly to stay on track
3. The 50/30/20 rule: 50% needs 30% wants 20% savings
4. Set up automatic transfers to savings
5. Treat yourself but within budget!
6. If over budget cut from shopping not food (priorities!)

You got this!
