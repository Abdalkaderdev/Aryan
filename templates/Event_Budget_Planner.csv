FORMULA CHEAT SHEET FOR ARYAN,,,,,
,,,,,
"1. SUM - Adds up numbers: =SUM(C12:C36) adds all estimated costs",,,,,
"2. Subtraction - Finding difference: =C12-D12 shows if under/over for each item",,,,,
"3. IF Statement - Makes decisions: =IF(condition, value_if_true, value_if_false)",,,,,
"4. Nested IF - Multiple conditions: =IF(B56>=80,""Great"",IF(B56>=50,""Good"",""Needs work""))",,,,,
"5. Percentage - Divide and multiply by 100: =SUM(B49:B54)/6*100",,,,,
,,,,,
PRO TIPS,,,,,
"- Use conditional formatting to highlight cells where Actual > Estimated (red = over budget)",,,,,
"- Add data validation for the Done? column to only allow 0 or 1",,,,,
"- Create a pie chart from categories to visualize spending!",,,,,
"- Freeze row 11 so headers stay visible while scrolling",,,,,
