LESSON 2: IF STATEMENTS - The Drama Queen of Excel
==========================================================
IF this THEN that ELSE something else
Just like your life decisions but more organized
==========================================================

PART A: EXAM RESULTS (the moment of truth)
==========================================================

Student,Score,Pass/Fail?,Grade,Scholarship?
Aryan,85,,,
BFF_1,92,,,
That_One_Friend,45,,,
Class_Topper,98,,,
Sleepy_One,55,,,
Coffee_Addict,78,,,
Last_Bencher,62,,,

FORMULAS TO USE:
Pass/Fail: =IF(B2>=50,"PASS","FAIL...yikes")
Grade: =IF(B2>=90,"A - Genius",IF(B2>=80,"B - Smart Cookie",IF(B2>=70,"C - Getting There",IF(B2>=50,"D - Survived","F - We Need To Talk"))))
Scholarship: =IF(B2>=90,"YES! Free Money!","Keep Trying Bestie")

==========================================================
PART B: SHOULD ARYAN GO OUT TODAY? (important decisions)
==========================================================

Factor,Status,Points
Weather,Sunny,
Money in Wallet,500,
Assignments Due,3,
Energy Level,7,
Friend Available,Yes,
Traffic,Heavy,

Decision Formula Examples:
=IF(B2="Sunny",10,0) --> Weather points
=IF(B3>200,10,5) --> Money check
=IF(B4=0,10,IF(B4<3,5,0)) --> Assignment guilt level
=IF(B6="Yes",10,0) --> Friend factor

FINAL VERDICT:
Total Points:,=SUM(C29:C34)
Should Go Out:,=IF(C43>=30,"GO HAVE FUN!","Stay home and Netflix")

==========================================================
PART C: SHOPPING BUDGET CHECKER (we all need this)
==========================================================

Item,Price,Budget,Can Buy?,Impulse Buy Warning
Cute Bag,2500,2000,,
Coffee Machine,3500,4000,,
Phone Case,500,1000,,
Sneakers,8000,5000,,
Books,1200,1500,,
Skincare,2000,1800,,

Can Buy Formula: =IF(B2<=C2,"Yes! Treat Yourself!","Put it back slowly...")
Impulse Warning: =IF(B2>C2*1.5,"DANGER: Step Away From The Cart","You're doing great sweetie")

==========================================================
NESTED IF (When life gets complicated):
==========================================================
=IF(condition1, result1, IF(condition2, result2, IF(condition3, result3, "else")))

Real example:
=IF(A1>=90,"Excellent",IF(A1>=70,"Good",IF(A1>=50,"Okay","Needs Chai & Motivation")))

==========================================================
AND / OR (The Relationship Status of Conditions):
==========================================================
=IF(AND(A1>50,B1>50),"Both conditions met - rare like finding parking","Nope not today")
=IF(OR(A1>90,B1>90),"At least one is great - like having backup plans","Back to the drawing board")

==========================================================
PRACTICE CHALLENGE:
==========================================================
Create a formula that tells Aryan:
- "Perfect Day" if weather is sunny AND money > 500 AND no assignments
- "Maybe Day" if at least 2 conditions are met
- "Netflix Day" if everything is against you

Good luck! You'll need IF, AND, OR - basically a therapy session in Excel form.

Next Lesson: VLOOKUP - Finding stuff like finding your keys (but actually works)
